Middleware in Express.js is a function that sits between the request and response cycle and has access to the following objects:

Request (req): The HTTP request object.
Response (res): The HTTP response object.
Next (next): A function to pass control to the next middleware function in the stack.
Key Responsibilities of Middleware:
Execute any code.
Modify the request and response objects.
End the request-response cycle (by sending a response).
Call the next() function to pass control to the next middleware.
If the middleware does not end the request-response cycle or call next(), the application will hang because no further action is taken.
