JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe token used for secure data transmission between parties. It contains three parts: header, payload, and signature. The header specifies the token type and algorithm, the payload contains claims (user data), and the signature ensures data integrity. JWTs are used in securing APIs by authenticating users. After login, a server issues a JWT, which clients include in subsequent requests' headers. This token allows the server to verify the user's identity and authorize access without storing session data server-side, enhancing scalability and efficiency.
