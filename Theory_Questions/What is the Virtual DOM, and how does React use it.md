The Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the actual DOM elements in your web app. React uses it to enhance performance and efficiency by creating a virtual representation of the UI, comparing changes, and then updating only the necessary parts of the real DOM. This process minimizes direct DOM manipulations, making updates faster. React's reconciliation process ensures only the differences are applied, improving performance and maintaining a smooth user experience. In essence, the Virtual DOM allows React to manage updates efficiently, providing a fast and responsive interface.
